## About Me

## About Me

I am a dual-degree **Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science** at [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/) (Japan) and [Ã‰cole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version) (France).  
I am currently conducting research in the [Ohtsuki Laboratory](https://www.ohtsuki.ics.keio.ac.jp/) under the supervision of **Professor Tomoaki Ohtsuki**, focusing on **deep learning methods for 3D human pose estimation**.

Previously, I completed a **5-month research internship** at [InterDigital R&D France](https://www.interdigital.com/), where I worked on **film grain analysis** and developed a **neural networkâ€“based similarity metric**.  
This work led to the **filing of two patents**.

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and signal processing, with a particular focus on **human state estimation**, **representation learning**, and **multimodal data analysis**.
