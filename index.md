## About Me

I am a dual-degree Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Keio University (Japan) and Ecole Centrale de Nantes (France). I am currently conducting research in the Ohtsuki Laboratory under the supervision of Professor Tomoaki Ohtsuki, focusing on deep learning methods for 3D human pose estimation.

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and signal processing, with a particular focus on human state estimation, representation learning, and multimodal data analysis.
## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning
